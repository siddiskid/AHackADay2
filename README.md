## Brief description
Wellness 360 is a website which shows users the nearest health and lifestyle locations and lets them book appointments with any of these places. It also has a chatbot which asks the user what symptoms they are facing and tells them the disease they are most likely affected by. Additionally, Wellness 360 Enterprise is a website for businesses, where they can register themselves with us and get updates on appointments booked with them.
